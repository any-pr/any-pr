# M9 gate — the CLIENT half. A tri-ecosystem instance must reach a rendered world and leave it cleanly.
#
# Every client fix in this kernel was verified by launching the game and reading the log by hand, so none of them
# was protected against the next change. This gate is that protection: it drives a real client into a real world
# with -Dforbric.clientSmoke, then asserts the absence of each failure that has actually cost a world load here.
# Those check_absent lines are the point of the gate — they are a list of bugs, each one paid for.
#
# WHY IT KILLS BY PID. A developer (or a second agent session) may have their own Minecraft client open, and a
# name-matched kill would take it down with no warning and no way to tell whose it was. This gate kills the
# process tree it started and nothing else. The server gates now do the same, via await_server in lib.sh.
#
# The window between disconnect and exit is deliberate. Vanilla's own watchdog logs "Client shutdown from
# post-main" ~15s after main returns if a non-daemon thread is still alive, which is how a leaked mod thread
# announces itself — so the gate waits for the process to end on its own rather than killing it at the disconnect.
